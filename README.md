## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was different from the previous one, because I had to use hover effect in CSS. Also I had to hide eye icon, and only show it when hovered. Therefore, I learned how to use hover in CSS.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about positioning elements in CSS. I think understanding this subject is very important to effectively work in CSS
